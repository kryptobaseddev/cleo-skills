# Development Workflow Context Injection

**Protocol**: @protocols/contribution.md
**Type**: Context Injection (cleo-subagent)
**Version**: 3.0.0

---

## Purpose

Context injection for development workflow tasks spawned via cleo-subagent. Provides domain expertise for atomic commits with task traceability, conventional commit messages, and systematic release processes.

---

## Core Principle: Task-Driven Development

> **CRITICAL**: NO code changes or commits without a tracked task.

Every commit MUST be traceable to a CLEO task. This ensures:
- Work is planned and tracked
- Changes are reviewable and reversible
- Progress is measurable
- Context is preserved for future agents

---

## Immutable Constraints (WORKFLOW)

| ID | Rule | Enforcement |
|----|------|-------------|
| WF-001 | Task required | NO commits without CLEO task reference |
| WF-002 | Branch discipline | NO commits to main/master |
| WF-003 | Atomic commits | ONE logical change per commit |
| WF-004 | Conventional format | `<type>(<scope>): <description>` |
| WF-005 | Tests before push | Relevant tests MUST pass |

---

## Task Tracking Integration

### Before Any Work

```bash
# 1. Verify you have a task
cleo focus show

# 2. If no task, find or create one
cleo find "relevant query"
cleo add "Task title" --description "What you're doing" --parent T001
cleo focus set T123
```

### Commit Message Format

**MUST** include task reference:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body explaining why>

Task: T123
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Example:**
```
fix(auth): prevent token expiry race condition

The refresh token was being invalidated before the new access
token was validated, causing intermittent auth failures.

Task: T1456
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

---

## Branch & Subagent Awareness

### Single Branch Reality

Subagents share the parent session's branch. This means:

- All work happens on the same branch
- No parallel feature branches from subagents
- Commits are sequential, not parallel
- Worktrees needed for true branch isolation

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Feature work (typical pattern)
main → feature/T123-description → PR → main

# Branch naming
feature/T123-auth-improvements     # Task-prefixed
fix/T456-token-validation          # Bug fix
```

---

## Gate System (Simplified)

Not all gates apply to all changes. Follow the decision matrix.

### G0: Pre-Flight Check

**Always required.**

```bash
# 1. Verify task context
cleo focus show
# MUST have a focused task

# 2. Check branch
git branch --show-current
# MUST NOT be main/master

# 3. Check for uncommitted work
git status --porcelain
# Review staged/unstaged changes
```

### G1: Classify Change

| Type | Description | Tests Needed | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New feature | Related tests | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Regression test | PATCH |
| `docs` | Documentation | None | None |
| `refactor` | Code restructure | Affected tests | PATCH |
| `test` | Test additions | The new tests | None |
| `chore` | Maintenance | None | None |
| `perf` | Performance | Perf tests | PATCH |
| `security` | Security fix | Security tests | PATCH |

### G2: Testing (Smart Scope)

**NOT always full test suite.** CI runs full tests on push.

| Change Type | Test Scope | Command |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| `feat` | Related module tests | `bats tests/unit/feature.bats` |
| `fix` | Regression + affected | `bats tests/unit/affected.bats` |
| `docs` | None (CI validates) | Skip |
| `refactor` | Affected modules | `bats tests/unit/module*.bats` |
| `test` | The new tests only | `bats tests/unit/new.bats` |
| `chore` | Syntax check only | `bash -n scripts/*.sh` |

**When to run full suite locally:**
- Before release (version bump)
- Major refactoring
- Cross-cutting changes
- User explicitly requests

```bash
# Full suite (when needed)
./tests/run-all-tests.sh

# Targeted tests (typical)
bats tests/unit/specific-feature.bats
bats tests/integration/workflow.bats

# Quick syntax check
bash -n scripts/*.sh lib/*.sh
```

### G3: Commit

```bash
# 1. Get task info
task_id=$(cleo focus show --quiet)

# 2. Stage changes (be specific for atomic commits)
git add scripts/specific-file.sh lib/related.sh

# 3. Create commit with task reference
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(auth): prevent token expiry race condition

The refresh token was being invalidated before validation.

Task: T1456
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### G4: Push (Triggers CI)

```bash
# Push branch (CI runs full tests)
git push origin HEAD

# CI will run:
# - Full test suite
# - ShellCheck linting
# - JSON validation
# - Documentation drift check
# - Installation test
```

### G5: Version Bump (Release Only)

**Only for releases**, not every commit.

```bash
# 1. Preview
./dev/bump-version.sh --dry-run patch

# 2. Execute
./dev/bump-version.sh patch

# 3. Validate
./dev/validate-version.sh

# 4. Reinstall locally
./install.sh --force
cleo version
```

### G6: Tag & Release

**GitHub Actions handles release creation.**

```bash
# 1. Create annotated tag
git tag -a v${VERSION} -m "${TYPE}: ${SUMMARY}"

# 2. Push tag (triggers release workflow)
git push origin v${VERSION}

# 3. Push branch
git push origin HEAD

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Builds release tarball
# - Creates GitHub Release
# - Generates release notes
# - Uploads artifacts
```

## Quick Decision Matrix

### What Tests to Run?

| Change | Local Tests | Rely on CI |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Single file fix | Related unit test | Yes |
| New feature | Feature tests | Yes |
| Docs only | None | Yes |
| Schema change | Schema tests | Yes |
| Cross-cutting refactor | Full suite | Yes |
| Release prep | Full suite | Yes |

### Do I Need a Version Bump?

| Change | Bump | Tag |
|--------|------|-----|
| `feat` | minor | Yes |
| `fix` | patch | Yes |
| `docs` | No | No |
| `refactor` | patch | Yes |
| `test` | No | No |
| `chore` | No | No |
| `perf` | patch | Yes |
| `security` | patch | Yes |

## Task System Integration

@skills/_shared/task-system-integration.md

### CLEO Integration Commands

```bash
# Task lifecycle
cleo focus show              # Current task
cleo focus set T123          # Set focus
cleo complete T123           # Mark done

# Find existing work
cleo find "query"            # Search tasks
cleo list --status pending   # Pending work

# Create new work
cleo add "Title" --parent T001 --description "..."

# Session management
cleo session status          # Current session
cleo session end --note "Completed X, Y, Z"
```

---

## Subagent Protocol

@skills/_shared/subagent-protocol-base.md

### Output Requirements

1. MUST write workflow summary to: `{{OUTPUT_DIR}}/{{DATE}}_{{TOPIC_SLUG}}.md`
2. MUST append ONE line to: `{{MANIFEST_PATH}}`
3. MUST return ONLY: "Workflow complete. See MANIFEST.jsonl for summary."
4. MUST NOT return full commit/release details in response

---

## Complete Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix (Typical)

```bash
# 1. Verify task
cleo focus show
# Output: T1456 - Fix token validation

# 2. Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Run relevant test
bats tests/unit/auth.bats

# 4. Stage specific files
git add lib/auth.sh scripts/login.sh

# 5. Commit with task
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(auth): prevent token expiry race condition

Task: T1456
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# 6. Push (CI handles full tests)
git push origin HEAD

# 7. Mark task complete
cleo complete T1456
```

### Example 2: Documentation Only

```bash
# 1. Verify task
cleo focus show  # T1550 - Update README

# 2. Make doc changes
# ... edit docs ...

# 3. No tests needed (CI validates)

# 4. Commit
git add docs/ README.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: update installation instructions

Task: T1550
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# 5. Push
git push origin HEAD

# 6. Complete
cleo complete T1550
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| No task reference | Untracked work | Create/find task first |
| Committing to main | Bypass review | Use feature branches |
| Running full tests always | Slow iteration | Use smart test scope |
| Skipping CI | Missing validations | Always push, let CI run |
| Manual release creation | Inconsistent releases | Use tag, GH Actions |
| Giant commits | Hard to review/revert | Atomic commits |
| Vague commit messages | Lost context | Conventional + task ref |

---

## Critical Rules Summary

1. **Always have a task** before making changes
2. **Always include task reference** in commit message
3. **Never commit to main/master** directly
4. **Run relevant tests** locally, not always full suite
5. **Let CI validate** with full test suite on push
6. **Use tags for releases** - GitHub Actions handles the rest
7. **One logical change** per commit (atomic)
8. **Conventional commit format** with task reference
