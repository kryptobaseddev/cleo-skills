name: ct-spec-writer
description: Technical specification writing using RFC 2119 language for clear, unambiguous requirements. Creates protocol specifications, technical requirements, API specifications, and architecture documents with testable requirements and compliance criteria. Use when writing specifications, defining protocols, documenting requirements, or creating API contracts. Triggers on specification tasks, protocol definition needs, or requirement documentation.

# Specification Writer Context Injection

**Protocol**: @protocols/specification.md
**Type**: Context Injection (cleo-subagent)
**Version**: 2.0.0

---

## Purpose

Context injection for specification writing tasks spawned via cleo-subagent. Provides domain expertise for creating clear, unambiguous technical specifications using RFC 2119 language.

---

## Capabilities

1. **Protocol Specifications** - Define behavior rules with RFC 2119 keywords
2. **Technical Requirements** - Document system requirements with constraints
3. **API Specifications** - Define interfaces, schemas, and contracts
4. **Architecture Documents** - Document system design decisions

---

## RFC 2119 Keywords (MANDATORY)

Use these keywords with their precise meanings:

| Keyword | Meaning | Compliance |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **MUST** | Absolute requirement | 95-98% |
| **MUST NOT** | Absolute prohibition | 93-97% |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended unless good reason exists | 75-85% |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged unless good reason exists | 75-85% |
| **MAY** | Truly optional | 40-60% |

---

## Specification Structure

### Standard Layout

```markdown
# {Specification Title} v{X.Y.Z}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

---

## Overview

{2-3 sentence summary of what this spec defines}

---

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| {term} | {definition} |

---

## Requirements

### {Category 1}

**REQ-001**: {Requirement description}
- Rationale: {Why this requirement exists}
- Verification: {How to verify compliance}

### {Category 2}

**REQ-002**: {Requirement description}
...

---

## Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Enforcement |
|----|------------|-------------|
| CON-001 | {constraint} | {how enforced} |

---

## Compliance

A system is compliant if:
1. {condition 1}
2. {condition 2}
3. {condition 3}

Non-compliant implementations SHOULD {remediation}.
```

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Precise
- Every requirement MUST be testable
- Avoid ambiguous terms ("appropriate", "reasonable", "adequate")
- Use specific values, not ranges when possible

### Be Complete
- Define all terms that might be misunderstood
- Cover error cases and edge conditions
- Specify what happens when requirements conflict

### Be Organized
- Group related requirements
- Use consistent numbering (REQ-XXX, CON-XXX)
- Cross-reference related sections

---

## Output Location

Specifications go in: `docs/specs/{{SPEC_NAME}}.md`

---

## Task System Integration

@skills/_shared/task-system-integration.md

### Execution Sequence

1. Read task: `{{TASK_SHOW_CMD}} {{TASK_ID}}`
2. Set focus: `{{TASK_FOCUS_CMD}} {{TASK_ID}}` (if not already set by orchestrator)
3. Write specification to `docs/specs/{{SPEC_NAME}}.md`
4. Append manifest entry to `{{MANIFEST_PATH}}`
5. Complete task: `{{TASK_COMPLETE_CMD}} {{TASK_ID}}`
6. Return summary message

---

## Subagent Protocol

@skills/_shared/subagent-protocol-base.md

### Output Requirements

1. MUST write specification to: `docs/specs/{{SPEC_NAME}}.md`
2. MUST append ONE line to: `{{MANIFEST_PATH}}`
3. MUST return ONLY: "Specification complete. See MANIFEST.jsonl for summary."
4. MUST NOT return specification content in response

### Manifest Entry Format

```json
{"id":"spec-{{SPEC_NAME}}-{{DATE}}","file":"{{DATE}}_spec-{{SPEC_NAME}}.md","title":"Specification: {{TITLE}}","date":"{{DATE}}","status":"complete","agent_type":"specification","topics":["specification","{{DOMAIN}}"],"key_findings":["Defined N requirements in M categories","Established X constraints with enforcement rules","Compliance criteria: summary"],"actionable":true,"needs_followup":["{{IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_IDS}}"],"linked_tasks":["{{TASK_ID}}"]}
```
