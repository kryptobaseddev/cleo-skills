name: ct-documentor
description: Documentation creation, editing, and review with CLEO style guide compliance. Coordinates specialized skills for lookup, writing, and review. Use when creating or updating documentation files, consolidating scattered documentation, or validating documentation against style standards. Triggers on documentation tasks, doc update requests, or style guide compliance checks.

# Documentation Specialist Context Injection

**Protocol**: @protocols/implementation.md
**Type**: Context Injection (cleo-subagent)
**Version**: 3.0.0

---

## Purpose

Context injection for documentation tasks spawned via cleo-subagent. Orchestrates documentation workflows by coordinating specialized skills for lookup, writing, and review.

---

## Skill Coordination

| Skill | Purpose | Invoke When |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ct-docs-lookup` | Query existing docs, find references | Discovery phase, checking what exists |
| `ct-docs-write` | Create/edit docs with CLEO style | Writing or updating content |
| `ct-docs-review` | Check compliance with style guide | Quality validation before completion |

---

## Core Principle: MAINTAIN, DON'T DUPLICATE

```
BEFORE creating ANY new file, you MUST:
1. Search for existing documentation on the topic
2. Identify the canonical location for this information
3. UPDATE the existing file instead of creating a new one
4. Only create new files when NO suitable location exists
```

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery (MANDATORY)

Before writing anything, discover what exists:

```bash
# List documentation structure
Glob: pattern="docs/**/*.md"

# Search for existing content on topic
Grep: pattern="{TOPIC_KEYWORDS}" path="docs/"

# Check for related files
Grep: pattern="{RELATED_TERMS}" path="docs/" output_mode="files_with_matches"
```

**Invoke `/ct-docs-lookup`** for deeper documentation research.

### Phase 2: Assess

| Question | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Does a doc file for this topic exist? | UPDATE that file |
| Is the info scattered across files? | CONSOLIDATE into canonical location |
| Is there a related doc that should include this? | ADD section to that file |
| Is this truly new with no home? | CREATE minimal new file |

### Phase 3: Write/Update

**Invoke `/ct-docs-write`** for content creation.

**For EXISTING files:**
1. Read the current content
2. Identify the correct section for new info
3. Add/update content IN PLACE
4. Preserve existing structure
5. Update any version numbers or dates

**For CONSOLIDATION:**
1. Identify all files with related content
2. Choose the canonical location
3. Move content to canonical file
4. Add deprecation notices to old locations
5. Update cross-references

**For NEW files (last resort):**
1. Confirm no existing location is suitable
2. Follow project's doc structure conventions
3. Add to appropriate docs/ subdirectory
4. Update any index or TOC files
5. Keep minimal - single topic focus

### Phase 4: Review

**Invoke `/ct-docs-review`** for quality validation.

## Anti-Duplication Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] Searched for existing docs on this topic
- [ ] Did NOT create a file that duplicates existing content
- [ ] Updated existing file if one existed
- [ ] Added deprecation notice if consolidating
- [ ] Cross-references are updated
- [ ] No orphaned documentation created

## Task System Integration

@skills/_shared/task-system-integration.md

### Task Workflow

```bash
# 1. Read task details
cleo show {TASK_ID}

# 2. Set focus
cleo focus set {TASK_ID}

# 3. Execute documentation workflow (phases 1-4)

# 4. Complete task when done
cleo complete {TASK_ID}

# 5. Link research if applicable
cleo research link {TASK_ID} {RESEARCH_ID}
```

## Subagent Protocol

@skills/_shared/subagent-protocol-base.md

### Output Requirements

1. MUST write documentation output to: `{{OUTPUT_DIR}}/`
2. MUST append ONE line to: `{{MANIFEST_PATH}}`
3. MUST return ONLY: "Documentation complete. See MANIFEST.jsonl for summary."
4. MUST NOT return documentation content in response

### Output File Format

Write to `{{OUTPUT_DIR}}/`:

```markdown
# Documentation Update: {TITLE}

**Date**: {DATE} | **Agent**: ct-documentor | **Status**: complete

---

## Summary

{What was updated and why}

## Changes Made

### File: {path/to/file.md}
- {Change 1}
- {Change 2}

## Files NOT Created (Avoided Duplication)

- {Considered creating X but updated Y instead}
- {Found existing coverage in Z}

## Verification

- [ ] Changes don't duplicate existing content
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] Examples tested
- [ ] Style guide compliance verified via ct-docs-review
```

### Manifest Entry

Append ONE line to `{{MANIFEST_PATH}}`:

```json
{"id":"docs-{TOPIC}-{DATE}","file":"{DATE}_docs-{TOPIC}.md","title":"Documentation Update: {TITLE}","date":"{DATE}","status":"complete","agent_type":"documentation","topics":["documentation","{topic}"],"key_findings":["Updated {file} with {change}","Consolidated {topic} docs into {canonical-location}","Avoided duplication by updating existing {file}"],"actionable":false,"needs_followup":[],"linked_tasks":["{TASK_ID}"]}
```

---

## Completion Requirements

- [ ] Discovery phase completed (searched existing docs)
- [ ] Core principle followed (maintain, don't duplicate)
- [ ] `/ct-docs-write` invoked for content creation
- [ ] `/ct-docs-review` invoked for quality validation
