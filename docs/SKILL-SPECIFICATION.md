# Skill Specification

Strict guidelines for all skills in this repository, adhering to the [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Frontmatter Rules

Every `SKILL.md` must begin with a YAML frontmatter block delimited by `---`.

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, `-` only. No leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens. Must match parent directory name. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. Non-empty. Must describe what the skill does AND when to use it. Include trigger keywords for agent discovery. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements if any. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value map (string to string). |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited tool list (experimental, agent-specific). |

### Name Validation

Pattern: `/^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/`

- Minimum 1 character, maximum 64 characters
- Only lowercase letters, digits, and single hyphens
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Directory name must exactly match the `name` field

### Description Guidelines

The description serves as the primary discovery mechanism across agents. It must:

1. State what the skill does (capability keywords)
2. State when to use it (trigger phrases)
3. Include specific tool/platform names for matching
4. Stay under 1024 characters

## Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required
├── references/           # Optional, deep-dive documentation
│   ├── topic-a.md
│   └── topic-b.md
├── scripts/              # Optional, executable helpers
└── assets/               # Optional, templates or data files
```

### Rules

- `SKILL.md` is required at the skill root
- File references from SKILL.md must be one level deep (no nested chains like `references/sub/file.md`)
- Reference files should be Markdown
- No executable code in `SKILL.md` body beyond illustrative examples

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills load in three tiers to manage context budgets:

| Tier | Content | Token Budget | When Loaded |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Metadata | `name` + `description` | ~100 tokens | Startup (all skills) |
| Instructions | Full SKILL.md body | <5000 tokens | On activation |
| Resources | `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` | On-demand | When referenced |

### Body Size Limits

- SKILL.md body: under 500 lines (hard limit for this repo)
- Recommended: under 5000 tokens
- Move detailed content to `references/` for progressive disclosure

## Validation Requirements

All skills must pass these checks:

1. **Name pattern**: Matches `/^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/`
2. **No consecutive hyphens**: Name contains no `--`
3. **Directory match**: Parent directory name equals frontmatter `name`
4. **Description present**: Non-empty, under 1024 characters
5. **Body length**: Under 500 lines
6. **References depth**: All referenced files are one level deep from SKILL.md
7. **No agent-specific fields**: Only standard spec fields in frontmatter for portability

## Cross-Agent Compatibility

Skills in this repo target the broadest agent compatibility:

| Agent | Discovery Path | SKILL.md Support |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | Native |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/skills/` | Native |
| Copilot | `.github/skills/` | Native |
| Others | Manual copy | Read as Markdown |

For maximum reach, install skills to `.agents/skills/` (broadest default discovery).

## Index Manifest

The `skills.json` at the project root is auto-generated by `scripts/build-index.sh`. It provides machine-readable metadata for tooling and registries. Never edit it manually.
