# cleo-skills

A curated collection of agent skills following the [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). Each skill is a standalone `SKILL.md` consumable by any compatible AI coding agent — Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and others.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [ct-gitbook](skills/ct-gitbook/) | Comprehensive guide for the modern GitBook platform |

## Installation

### With CAAMP

```bash
caamp skills install /path/to/cleo-skills/skills/ct-gitbook
```

### Manual

Copy or symlink the skill directory into your agent's skills location:

```bash
# Claude Code
cp -r skills/ct-gitbook ~/.claude/skills/ct-gitbook

# Codex
cp -r skills/ct-gitbook .agents/skills/ct-gitbook

# Copilot (VS Code)
cp -r skills/ct-gitbook .github/skills/ct-gitbook
```

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create a directory under `skills/` matching your skill name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with valid YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description` required)
3. Add reference files under `references/` for deep-dive content
4. Run the index builder to validate and update `skills.json`:

```bash
bash scripts/build-index.sh
```

See [docs/SKILL-SPECIFICATION.md](docs/SKILL-SPECIFICATION.md) for the full specification.

## Skills Index

The `skills.json` manifest is auto-generated by `scripts/build-index.sh`. It extracts frontmatter from each `SKILL.md`, lists reference files, and validates naming rules. Run it after any skill changes.

## Specification Compliance

All skills in this repository comply with:

- [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) (name, description, directory structure)
- [SKILL-SPECIFICATION.md](docs/SKILL-SPECIFICATION.md) (additional rules enforced for this repo)
